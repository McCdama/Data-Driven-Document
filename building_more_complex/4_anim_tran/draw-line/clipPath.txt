A <clipPath> is an SVG element that:

- is sized by its children.
If a <clipPath> contains a circle, it will only paint content within that circle's bounds.

- can be referenced by another SVG element, using <clipPath> id's.


SVG convention: <defs>
is used to store any re-usable definitions that are used later in the <svg>.

By placing any <clipPath> or gradients in our <defs> element, we'll make our code more accessible.
also we'll know where to look when we're debugging.
